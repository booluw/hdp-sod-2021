The frontiers of the kingdom of God cannot be extended without people who are passionate for souls. We talk about the second coming of Christ but there are millions of people who havenâ€™t heard about the first. (Romans 10:10-15). The revival of the last days is not one oriented with a myriad of miracles but a great cloud of saints who are captured for the Lord Jesus.  The class focuses on strategic missions and discipleship and encourages believers to remain fused on the Lord even in perilous times.

It is therefore pertinent that believers understand how to represent God effectively via platforms offered by music and others forms of performing arts/entertainment such as poetry, spoken words, dancing, drawing etc. The class will focus on building and grooming aspiring artist and entertainers for kingdom exploits, those who will be rooted in Godâ€™s word, not compromising their call for treasures.

We are in the days of his power. However, liberalist today negate the power of the spirit and proclaim that the days of miracles are gone, forgetting that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever. (Hebrews 13:8). The church today cannot influence cosmos by just logic and intellect but via a demonstration of power will the church continue to advance over the gates of hell and the kingdom of darkness.

The world is in great need of teachers who are accurate in handling the scriptures and have deep understanding on doctrines (2Timothy 2:15). This class shall focus on church building, its origin, its relationship to Jesus, its role in salvation, its disciplines and destiny and also addresses some vital biblical doctrines that are becoming controversial in todayâ€™s world such as eternal security, tithing, rapture and so on and also teach how to stand firm while defending the faith amidst believers.

            The concept of kingdom prosperity and wealth has become a subject of contention in todayâ€™s world. We have lots of doctrine and ideologies that either promotes or conflicts individual opinions on finance. Nevertheless, the word of God remains supreme, it is Godâ€™s will that we prosper and be in good health (3John 1:2), God delights in the prosperity of his servants not otherwise! This class seeks to strike a balance between the twine, that the believer has all it takes to be holy and wealthy and ought to handle wealth as a tool for kingdom influence and not a god to be worshipped.
